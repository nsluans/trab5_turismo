        Porto de Galinhas, is a district located in the city of Ipojuca, in Pernambuco, about 60 km from Recife. A
        vila is one of the best beach destinations not only in the Northeast, but in Brazil. I don't need to say much to
        explain the place: its beaches, characterized by green waters and between natural pools, catch the eye
        and draw praise from the most unbelievers. The district has the facility of being close to the International Airport
        from Recife, a fact that makes getting to Porto de Galinhas much easier. Its warm and pleasant waters throughout the year
        invite for a dip and have the potential to conquer people of all ages.

        with crystal clear water. And the best beach in Porto de Galinhas, Praia de Muro Alto, cannot be left out of the

        the best time to go to Porto de Galinhas is from September to March. That's because, it's in these months when it rains less
        and that the sun shines practically every day. To avoid overcrowding on the sand, higher prices with accommodation
        and queues at restaurants, avoid traveling to Porto de Galinhas during holidays.</p>
